        meh social does not stand for any form of white supremacy, nazi iconography or support of any sort,
        nor racism, homophobia, transphobia, or any other harmful/shitty views. <strong>it will not be tolerated
        on meh social.</strong> if you wish to espouse your horrible views, do it somewhere else. you do not have
        any clout or weight enough to offset being a terrible person.

        please report any violations of the rules (even if you're not sure). tim is happy to review and
